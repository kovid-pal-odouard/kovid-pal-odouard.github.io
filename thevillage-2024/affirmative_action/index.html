        <h1>Normative First: An Approach to Affirmative Action</h1>
    </div>


    <div class="essay">
        <p class="indent">
            Much of the debate around affirmative action in America has been around its legality – in large part due to the rich judicial history (both at the federal and state level) on the matter since the years following the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Understanding the <span class="italic">legality</span> of <span class="italic">particular</span> existing practices that fall under the umbrella of affirmative action is an important endeavor, no doubt – it is, after all, the mechanism by which the courts operate. Court precedent alone, though, is not enough to make a decisive  <span class="italic">normative judgment</span> on a type of practice. First, legality is by no means a proxy for normative judgment. Laws are simply rules passed by legislatures and only exist in any relevant way if there is an executive willing and able to enforce them. A statement’s existence in the law is not grounds for a favorable normative judgment, it simply shows that people in power found it desirable and possible to enforce. American law has mandated segregation and slavery, denied all but propertied white men the right to vote, permitted child labor, and denied women autonomy, all of which any morally right-headed person would object to. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
             Second, assessments of particular practices can lead to erroneous judgements on the type of practice as a whole. Generalizing normative assessment of the sorts of affirmative action in place today to form a normative assessment of affirmative action as a whole would be mistaken – even if one comes to the conclusion that current practices are immoral, that does not rule out the possibility of moral ones.  
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Whereas all these scholarly approaches to revolution may seem very different – Tocqueville and Marx focus on class relations; Kurzman denies the assumption that revolutions are written in inevitable sociological forces and provides an “anti-explanation” (5) of revolution as being contingent on people’s experiences and perceptions; Arendt is concerned with where the imagination of revolution comes from – they still share this fundamental similarity. As shown by Kurzman’s case, the question is not necessarily: why did it have to be there and then? For him, it didn’t. The questions are: why there? Why then?               
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Therein lies the importance of a philosophical account of affirmative action. Here, my scope will be limited to just the affirmative action practices of admissions at not-for-profit universities. This is, in part, an effort to introduce a new approach to a body of arguments that have been particularly prone to the two aforementioned flaws (particularly the second,) but also due to the disproportionate social importance of these institutions. Instead of beginning with existing practices and normatively evaluating them, I will (with a focus on the empirical realities of America as a whole and higher education in that picture) provide an account that <span class="italic">begins</span> with normative assessment of their purpose and from it derives proposed practices.

<!-- THE PURPOSE OF HIGHER EDUCATION IN AMERICA -->
    <div class="essay">
        <p class="bold">The purpose of higher education in America</p>
    </div>
    <div class="essay">
        <p class="indent">
            The purpose of higher education is contentious. Some hold that the university or college is a pre-professional training center: its purpose is to train its students in skills they will use once employed. At the other end of a spectrum is what could be construed as an Arisotleian viewpoint, which from its emphasis on the cultivation of human virtues positions the university or college as a place to develop the intellect. Of course, different approaches to the question of the purpose of higher education can lead to similar conclusions. The framework of Nicomachean Ethics might encourage a liberal arts education, but a utilitarian framework could conceivably be used to justify the same. One could make the argument that a liberal arts education creates the greatest happiness of the greatest number because it creates a citizenry sensitive to the questions of what a just life and society may look like; one could make the argument that, no, in fact, a strictly skill-based pre-professional education creates the greatest happiness of the greatest number because a society of skilled experts in their domain is most likely to run smoothly and progress. All this is to say that, while an interesting endeavor, deducing the role of higher education from first principles is not going to reflect some syllogistically-derivable truth, but an individual disposition on what human life and society ought to look like. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            The indeterminate outcome of this purely <span class="italic">a priori</span> approach might prompt some empirical exploration. To help us answer “what is the purpose of higher education?”, it might be useful to ask “what outcomes do higher education create?” While this may seem at odds with the approach of this paper – which is to come to a moral judgment first – the reasoning for the approach lies in the propensity to focus too narrowly on particular affirmative action practices and mistakenly universalize from there. If this paper were a philosophical approach to the purpose of higher education, an excessively empirical approach might fall victim to a similar flaw. The goal here, though, is not to imagine the ideal higher education, it is to imagine the ideal affirmative action practices (if there are any) <span class="italic">given the existence of higher education as it is.</span> This is why an empirical examination of contemporary universities and colleges is methodologically relevant. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            That said, here are some outcomes of higher education. In the 118th congress*, while 38 percent of American ages 25 and older have a bachelor’s degree or higher, all but 1 senator and 94 percent of house representatives do; while 14 percent of Americans of the same age have a graduate degree, 64 percent of house representatives and 78 percent of senators do (US Census Bureau, “Educational Attainment”; Schaeffer). Of the 114 justices appointed to the Supreme Court, 7 lacked a college education, and none have since 1942, when just 5.5 percent of men had completed four years of college (US Census Bureau, “Percentage of the US”). In Fortune 500 company boards, only 2 percent of members had no degree (Heidrick & Struggles), a figure around 4 percent (Zippia Research Team) for boards in general. 88 percent of millionaires graduated from college, and 52 percent have a graduate degree (Ramsey Solutions), The lawmakers, the law interpreters, the directors of American business, the wealthy – all those in positions of power overwhelmingly (in some places, near-ubiquitously) and disproportionately receive a higher education. Beyond all these statistics, there is a wide body of studies and sociological theory explaining the causal mechanisms underlying these statistics: a higher education doesn’t just provide skills, but intangible cultural capital and access to closed networks that make access to positions of power easier (Biancani & McFarland; Bourdieu; Kezar). Higher education, in most cases, is a precondition for power. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Universities and colleges, finding themselves in this role as the precondition for wielding societal power, ought to behave accordingly. Whether or not this <span class="italic">should</span> be the case – perhaps such positions should be more open to those without a university education, perhaps postsecondary institutions shouldn’t find themselves in a position in which they have an obligation to overarching societal projects – they have nevertheless found themselves in this position. However the reality of that role is normatively evaluated, it is still a reality. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            While some might object to the universality of this conception of the place of postsecondary institutions and argue that, given how they are structured, for-profit institutions have a more pressing obligation to their shareholders. However, only about 5 percent of America’s postsecondary students are actually enrolled in for-profit institutions (Hansen). While questions on the place of extractive practices in education are worth addressing, the broadness of the scope of philosophical and normative questions engaging with them elicits and their simultaneously limited relevance in the American higher education system puts them outside of the purview of my mission here. 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            This prompts the question: given colleges’ and universities’ aforementioned role, and given the present state of American societal structure, are there any affirmative action practices that might serve to improve problems with those structures?

<!-- LITERATURE AS PROVIDING LANGUAGE: FRANCE  -->
    <div class="essay">
        <p class="bold">Literature as providing language: France</p>
    </div> 
    <div class="essay">
        <p class="indent">
            Perhaps a more useful account of these nations’ revolutionary cultures and their relationship with their respective literatures is as follows: revolutionary cultures were not necessarily looking to enact the teachings of their literary predecessors, but their literary predecessors gave them a language they used to conceive of themselves and their goals. François Furet’s analysis (1981) of French revolutionary culture is a compelling case for such an account. For him, “French society… was desperately searching for responsible spokesmen” (36) – it could not find such a spokesmen in the parlements, as they “throughout the century, gave repeated proof of their conservatism, since they condemned the Encyclopédie” (36), among other offenses (given they were, after all, a body composed of nobles) so French society turned to the <span class="italic">philosophes</span>. This phenomenon can even be conceived of as a structural tendency: the steady loss of political function of the nobility in the years leading to the revolution (a fundamental shift corresponding to the decline of feudalism) without the <span class="italic">Ancién Regime</span> allowing for a new ruling class “set up the writers as imaginary substitutes for that ruling class” (36). 
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            Regardless of whether this perception was a question of the contingent dispositions of French revolutionary culture or a structural tendency in French society, it serves as a framework to understand revolutionary culture from 1789 to Thermidor. For Furet, the revolution operated by “appropriat[ing] for its own benefit the interpretation of what was meant by the ‘people’s will’” (43). As such, Sieyès’ famous “What is the Third Estate?” conceived of the nobility as existing outside of the people, therefore legitimizing the ostracization of nobles and the symbols associated with them. Later, each successive government relied on the language of the people’s will for its legitimacy. On Robespierre from 1793-1794, Furet writes:
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
            he [Robespierre] was the people to the national representative body; it was continually necessary to establish, control and restore the perfect fit between the people and the various assemblies that claimed to speak in its name (above all the Convention), for without that perfect fit there could be no legitimate power, and the first duty of power was to maintain it: that was the function of Terror. (60) 
        </p>  
        <p>
            In terms of the initial hypothesis, the language of “the people’s will” and later “the people” in the discourse of French revolutionary culture can be thought of as a derivative of Enlightenment writing. Sieyès and Robespierre used language they learned from Enlightenment <span class="italic">philosophes’</span> conception of universal human dignity and the social contract, and the system of legitimation this practice ended up creating led to the violent aspect of French revolutionary culture. In Furet’s words: “Each successive political group pursued the same objective: to radicalise the Revolution, by making it consistent with its discourse,” (70) even to the point of violence. It didn’t matter what the philosophes’ actually thought or wrote, what mattered was the process by which members of the revolutionary culture appropriated their language for their own purposes, creating the self-radicalizing paradigm that Furet describes.

<!-- AMERICA AS RACIALLY SEGREGATED AND ECONOMICALLY UNEQUAL -->

        <p class="bold">America as racially segregated and economically unequal</p>

            <span class="italic">Racial segregation.</span> From 2014 to 2018, the neighborhood of an average white resident in America’s metropolitan areas was 71 percent white and 8 percent black; the neighborhood of an average black resident was 45 percent black; the neighborhood of an average Latino resident was 47 percent Latino, 32 percent white, and 11 percent black. The median dissimilarity index between black and white people in urban areas with a population of 1 million or more in 2020 was 52.8, meaning that in a given area, 52.8 percent of black people would have to move to establish a black-white ratio that would be reflective of the general demographics of the city (Cortright).
        <p class="indent">
            Whereas 80 percent of low-income black people live in low-income communities, only 50 percent low-income white people do (Hadden Loh et al.). White adults over twenty five are almost double as likely to have a college degree (Juhn & Potter). The median net worth for non-Latino white people in 2022 was $285,000, whereas the median net worth for non-Latino black people was $44,000 (Federal Reserve, “Board Publication”). From 1970 (just 6 years since the end of legal segregation)  to 2010, the percent of white students in a typical black student’s school decreased by 3 percent (Orfield et. al). One third of black children are poor, compared to 10 percent of white children (Fass & Cauthen); fewer than 1 in 10 of those white children experience poverty for ten or more years, whereas nearly all of those black children do (Corcoran). 45 percent of black children born in the middle income quintile fall into the bottom as adults, whereas only 16 percent of white children do (Isaacs). For decades, the white unemployment rate has been half of the white unemployment rate (Williams &  Collins). Increasingly punitive criminal justice laws and disproportionate police presence in predominantly black neighborhoods have led to the mass incarceration of black men, to the point where black men are disenfranchised at a rate of almost one in eight in 2008 (King). A long history of systematically unequal lending practices –through a combination of discrimination in banking and racially biased federal policy (Jackson)– meant that white Americans have been able to buy homes and accrue generational wealth while black Americans found themselves in under-resourced and “redlined” urban neighborhoods (Katznelson).

            In America, races are physically <span class="italic">separate</span> and suffer <span class="italic">unequal</span> outcomes. This is a paradigm that is and has been supported by both the law (particularly zoning and carceral laws) and the private sector.

            <span class="italic">Economic Inequality.</span> Economic Inequality. Whereas real GDP per capita has increased by a factor of 2.58 (St Louis Federal Reserve),  the benefits of this growth have been reaped unequally. In the second quarter of 2023, the top 10 percent wealthiest Americans possessed 69 percent of the nation’s wealth; the top 1 percent possessed 31.4 percent (Federal Reserve, “Wealth Distribution”). Whereas in 1985, the middle 40 percent accounted for 35.6 percent of net personal wealth and the top 1 percent for 24.4 percent, by 2021 the middle 40 percent had just a 28.2 percent share and the top 1 percent a 35.3 percent share (Congressional Budget Office). From 1948 to 1973, typical workers’ compensation (adjusted for inflation) changed by 91.3 percent, corresponding to a 96.7 percent increase in worker productivity; from 1973 to 2013, compensation has increased a mere 9.2 percent compared to a 74.4 percent increase in productivity. Since Moody’s began tracking rent prices in 1999, rents have increased by 135 percent but incomes have only increased by 77 percent (not adjusted for inflation,) drastically increasing the burden of rent. The real wages of workers in the 10th percentile have decreased since 1979; employer provided health insurance has decreased from 61 percent to 31 percent for college graduates and 24 percent to 7 percent for high school graduates. While CEOs made 20 times their typical workers’ earnings in 1965 and 59 times as much in 1990, they made 296 times more in 2013 (Mishel et al.)and 399 times more in 2021 (Visram). A mathematical model based on rising income inequality alone is sufficient to explain the rising segregation by income of American metropolitan areas 1970.

            In America, the typical individual today is in many ways worse off and absolutely more segregated from the ultra-wealthy than the typical individual a generation ago, whereas the ultra-rich owners of the lion’s share of wealth are far better off than they have ever been.

<!-- TYPES OF SOLUTIONS RELEVANT TO POSTSECONDARY INSTITUTIONS -->

            In many cases, the sorts of measures postsecondary universities can take in working towards integration are also helpful for expanding access to capital, so the following brief list of potential practices is combined. 
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
            1. <span class="italic">Outreach programs to high schools in less wealthy or redlined areas, potentially with a financial aid component.</span> Encouraging students to apply to postsecondary institutions (and providing them with the means to do so) can allow postsecondary institutions to educate a more integrated set of individuals, and give individuals access to the capital that comes with that education. 
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
            2.  <span class="italic">For selective institutions: not looking at standardized test scores.</span> The disproportionate access to private tutoring and better resources provided by schools attended by more wealthy (and typically, whiter) students mean that SAT scores, for example, are more predictive of family income than anything else (Dixon-Roman, et. al). Removing them as an admissions criterion can allow less wealthy students or students from less well-resourced schools to have access to postsecondary education. 
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
            3. <span class="italic">For selective institutions: preferential treatment for qualified applicants from less wealthy families, attending less well-resourced school districts, and from redlined areas.</span> Favoring qualified applicants who suffer from the injustices detailed earlier is another way to create more integrated university environments and give access to capital to those who might not otherwise have it.
        </p>
        <p class="blockquote">
            4. <span class="italic">For selective institutions: Pre-college educational programs for less qualified applicants from less wealthy families, attending less well-resourced school districts, and from redlined areas.</span> The difficult conditions of life for these applicants, combined with the fact that they might need to begin working from a younger age (a program for working applicants is also conceivable) might make it harder for such applicants to reach the same level of attainment as their more privileged counterparts. Putting resources into a pre-college program that brings them to the same level of qualification as their peers (and helping them financially to allow them to attend) is another way to expand access to postsecondary education, integrating it more widely than any of the previous endeavors above might allow. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Practices 3 and 4 are both examples of affirmative action. Given postsecondary institutions’ empirical role as the precondition for wielding power and the access they provide to capital, these types of affirmative action seem like reasonable steps those institutions can take in addressing the societal problems they find themselves in a position to address.

            5. Therefore, affirmative action – if it works towards solving these issues – can be just 
        </p>
        <p>
            I find this argument – which is more focused on righting the wrongs in American society – can provide a useful alternative to much of the affirmative action discourse around diversity. In Carl Cohen’s objection to affirmative action, he points out that “[i]n universities and where information or argument is reported or discussed, <span class="italic">intellectual</span> diversity is indeed a value worthy of pursuit…Colleges and universities that could greatly enrich their intellectual diversity do not work very hard at that…Diversity of religion, diversity of life-style, diversity along any one of many other dimensions that really could provide more genuine enrichment is commonly ignored” (38). For Cohen, this creates a system where people are treated unequally on non “critical” grounds, which contradict the maxim that equals should be treated equally. While Cohen’s statements may seem hyperbolic to the truth – college and university admissions teams certainly attempt to at least have the appearance of admitting students of diverse walks of life – it is true that if the end of affirmative action were truly to maximize diversity, its racial focus would seem strange.
        </p>
        <p class="indent">
            The argument provided here does not fall to this objection. In this case, the grounds are critical. The people are not equal. Segregation and wealth inequality are some of the most morally relevant issues in American society, and postsecondary universities, in their unique position to address them, ought to do so.
